# bioreactor-mathematical-modeling
This repository contains all the scripts used to simulate cyanobacteria growth using mathematical modeling. 

A mathematical model was developed to simulate biomass growth within the custom-designed
bioreactor. While the primary focus is on capturing growth dynamics and carbon capture, the
model also provides a foundation for estimating potential glucose yield as a downstream appli-
cation. The framework integrates kinetic models, mass balance equations to represent carbon
uptake, and light attenuation models to account for spatial variations in light availability
within the system
